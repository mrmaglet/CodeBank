First attemt to document what I learned so far. Built my own documentation system. Changed to nextra instead of building my own. 

Allt content that is not MUI related is moved to the developer-notes repocitory instead. Most of the MUI stuff is just related to styles from MUI 4 and not really relevant with MUI 5 and the new sx prop.
